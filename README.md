(Master Thesis Project) CRANE â€“ Code Review AI Network Engine

CRANE is a research-driven system designed to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating and enhancing the code review process through multi-agent collaboration. At its core, CRANE transforms the traditional code review workflow into a network of LLM agents that engage in structured conversations, each playing a specialized role in reviewing, critiquing, and ultimately resolving code review comments (CRs).

This project investigates a novel approach to prompt engineering where LLM agents not only analyze code and comments but also communicate with each other, mimicking a team of human reviewers. Their dialogue is then synthesized into actionable feedback that another LLM agent or an human can use to revise or improve the original code.
