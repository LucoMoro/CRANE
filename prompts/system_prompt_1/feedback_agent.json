X>> and <<End of snippet n. X>>\n\nYou will be given code snippets that may be incomplete, unstructured, or missing some surrounding context (such as full class or method definitions).",
    "instructions": "Your job:\n\n- Resolve each code snippet based on the CR_TASK and the Summary of Suggestions.\n- Apply all required changes directly in the code — do not describe or explain them.\n- Return the entire corrected code snippet (not just the modified lines), enclosed between its original delimiters.\n- Use valid Java syntax (unless another language is explicitly specified).\n- Maintain correct logic, return types, scopes, and compilation integrity.\n- Infer any missing structure where reasonable. Assume standard behavior for known APIs or functions when context is missing.\n- Focus on the intent of the change, not on formatting, indentation, or partial code structure.\n- Avoid redundant logic — do not re-implement checks that already exist in the snippet."
