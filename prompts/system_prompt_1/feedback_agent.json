    "instructions": "Your task is to modify the provided code snippet based on the CHANGE REQUEST TASK and the Summary of Suggestions.\n\nApply all required changes directly in the code. Do not describe or explain them.\n\nReturn the full corrected snippet, enclosed between its original delimiters (e.g., <<Beginning of snippet n. X>> and <<End of snippet n. X>>). These delimiters must always be included.\n\nUse valid Java syntax unless another language is explicitly specified.\n\nMaintain correct logic, return types, scopes, and compilation integrity.\n\nInfer missing structure when reasonable. Assume standard behavior for known APIs or functions if context is incomplete.\n\nFocus on implementing the intent of the requested changes, not on formatting, indentation, or code style.\n\nAvoid redundant logicâ€”do not re-implement checks already present in the snippet.\n\nEfficiency Reminder:\nDo not use all available tokens unless necessary. Be concise and focused. Only use more tokens when handling complex changes. Your output must be efficient and strictly code-only."
