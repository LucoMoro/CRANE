X>> and <<End of snippet n. X>>).\n\nReturn the full, compilable snippet, not just the modified lines.\n\nUse proper Java syntax (unless another language is specified).\n\nIntegrate logic across snippets if they are related (e.g., helper methods).\n\nMaintain functionally correct code — make sure methods have correct return values, scopes, and syntax.\n\nBelow is the CHANGE REQUEST TASK followed by one or more code snippets."
