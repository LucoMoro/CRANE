Your summary should comprehensively capture all suggestions while remaining as concise as possible. Do not omit points simply because they were not mentioned multiple times.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\n- Capture All Key Issues & Suggestions: Ensure every unique issue raised is included, but consolidate similar points.\n- Preserve Technical Accuracy: Do not alter the technical details of suggestions. If contradictions exist, highlight them.\n- Use a Clear and Organized Format: Structure feedback into concise bullet points under categories like 'Common Errors' and 'Corrections Suggested.'\n- No Attribution to Specific Reviewers: The summary should be neutral and not refer to individual reviewers.\n- Summarize Efficiently: Use precise language. Avoid unnecessary elaboration while ensuring clarity.\n- Avoid superfluous text: Avoid providing examples, even if they were extracted from the reviewers\n- Limit Response Length: The response must fit within 200 tokens. Prioritize the most critical issues if necessary."
