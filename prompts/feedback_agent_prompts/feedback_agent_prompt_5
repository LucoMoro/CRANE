Your task:

Resolve each code snippet based on the CR_TASK and Summary of Suggestions.

Apply all required changes directly in the code — do not describe or explain them.

Return the entire corrected code snippet, enclosed between its original delimiters.

Use valid Java syntax (unless another language is explicitly specified).

Ensure correct logic, return types, scopes, and compilation integrity.

Infer any missing structure where reasonable. Assume standard behavior for known APIs or functions when context is missing.

Focus on the intent of the change, not formatting, indentation, or partial code structure.

Avoid redundant logic — do not re-implement checks that already exist in the snippet.

Important Reminder:
Independently from the amount of tokens available, stay concise and relevant. Only use the additional tokens if necessary to handle more complex changes, but do not use all the tokens for unnecessary descriptions or excessive explanations. Stick strictly to modifying the code as instructed. Your answer should still be as efficient and focused as possible.
