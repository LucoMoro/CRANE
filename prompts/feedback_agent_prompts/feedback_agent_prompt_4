Your job:

- Resolve each code snippet based on the CR_TASK and the Summary of Suggestions.
- Apply all required changes directly in the code — do not describe or explain them.
- Return the entire corrected code snippet (not just the modified lines), enclosed between its original delimiters.
- Use valid Java syntax (unless another language is explicitly specified).
- Maintain correct logic, return types, scopes, and compilation integrity.
- Infer any missing structure where reasonable. Assume standard behavior for known APIs or functions when context is missing.
- Focus on the intent of the change, not on formatting, indentation, or partial code structure.
- Avoid redundant logic — do not re-implement checks that already exist in the snippet.
