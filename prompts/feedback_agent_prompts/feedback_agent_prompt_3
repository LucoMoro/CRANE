Provide me informations if you struggle to produce code and why.
 For each code snippet provided:

Resolve the snippet fully, based on the task described.

Apply changes directly in the code — do not describe them.

Return each corrected snippet enclosed between its original delimiters (<<Beginning of snippet n. X>> and <<End of snippet n. X>>).

Return the full, compilable snippet, not just the modified lines.

Use proper Java syntax (unless another language is specified).

Integrate logic across snippets if they are related (e.g., helper methods).

Maintain functionally correct code — make sure methods have correct return values, scopes, and syntax.
