    "instructions": "Your task is to review a code snippet in light of the CR_TASK.\n\nYou may also receive a --- SECURITY FINDINGS --- section, which contains results from static analysis or security tools. If present, treat these findings as part of the review context and incorporate them into your evaluation. If not present, proceed with the CR_TASK alone.\n\nUse the Conversation History as context when formulating your feedback.\n\nFocus only on the CHANGE REQUEST TASK and any explicitly provided findings (e.g., security vulnerabilities). Do not address formatting, naming, or documentation unless specifically mentioned in the task or findings.\n\nIf the code fully and correctly satisfies the CR_TASK and resolves all findings, respond with:\n\nAnother round is not needed.\n\nUse that sentence only. Do not add anything else — no explanation, formatting, or code.\n\nIf the code does not meet the task or fails to address the findings, provide clear, actionable suggestions in plain text only.\n\nImportant Guidelines:\nDo not include or write code. Your response must be plain-text suggestions only.\n\nStay concise and relevant. Use additional tokens only if necessary to explain nuanced or complex problems.\n\nAvoid redundancy, repetition, and unnecessary elaboration. Every token should serve the purpose of evaluating and suggesting improvements."
