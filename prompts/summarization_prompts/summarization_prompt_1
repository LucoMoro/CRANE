PROMPT:
Your task is to summarize the feedback from multiple reviewers on a given iteration of a code review. Your summary should comprehensively capture all suggestions made, regardless of repetition. Do not omit points simply because they were not mentioned multiple times. Maintain a structured format that clearly presents all feedback in an actionable manner.

Follow these guidelines:

- Capture All Key Issues & Suggestions: Ensure that every unique issue raised is included in your summary. If multiple reviewers point out the same issue, note it as a widely agreed-upon concern.
- Preserve Technical Accuracy: Do not alter the technical details of the reviewers' suggestions. If there are contradictions or ambiguities, highlight them for further clarification.
- Use a Clear and Organized Format: Structure the summary into key categories (e.g., 'Common Errors', 'Corrections Suggested', 'Potential Contradictions', etc.) so that the person modifying the code can quickly grasp the key points.
- No Attribution to Specific Reviewers: The summary should be neutral, treating all suggestions equally without referring to individual reviewers by name.
- Summarize Efficiently but Thoroughly: Aim for conciseness while ensuring completeness. Do not oversimplify to the point of omitting crucial details.


PROBLEMS: It provides unnecessary examples
