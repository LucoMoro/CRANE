- Use a Clear and Organized Format: Structure feedback into concise bullet points under categories like 'Common Errors' and 'Corrections Suggested.'
- No Attribution to Specific Reviewers: The summary should be neutral and not refer to individual reviewers.
- Summarize Efficiently: Use precise language. Avoid unnecessary elaboration while ensuring clarity.
- Avoid superfluous text: Avoid providing examples, even if they were extracted from the reviewers
- Limit Response Length: The response must fit within 200 tokens. Prioritize the most critical issues if necessary.
